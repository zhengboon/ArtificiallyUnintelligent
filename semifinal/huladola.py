# A simple and short reference code of connecting to multiple hula drones in the wifi network.
# Make sure your laptop is in that network of hula drones and make sure all hula drones are online in that network
# This code uses pyhulax python library to connect to Hula Drone. 
# Refer to https://pyhulax.xenops.ae to learn how to use library to control movements of Hula drone swarm
# Ths code only shows you to get all video streams of all drones onto one computer so
# you can do multiple drone detection from one computer.
# You need pyhulax and dola.py

        # IMPORTANT CONCEPT: Break your plan into states and use if else statement to control the flow of the drone. 
        # For example, you can have a state variable for each drone that starts at 0. When state is 0, you can make the drone takeoff and then set state to 1. 
        # When state is 1, you can make the drone move forward for 2 seconds and then set state to 2. 
        # This way you can have a sequence of commands for your drone and control the flow of the commands by changing the state variable.
        #  You can also use timers to change states after certain amount of time.
